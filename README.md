The provided Python script creates a simple file sharing service using an HTTP server running on port 8010. Here's a summary of the project and its functionality:

1. HTTP Server Setup:
The script uses Python's http.server module to set up an HTTP server.
Files from the user's desktop directory (specifically, the OneDrive folder within the desktop) are served by the HTTP server.

3. Dynamic IP Address Retrieval:
The script dynamically retrieves the local IP address of the machine running the server using a UDP socket connection to Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8:80).
This IP address, along with the specified port (8010), forms the URL where the HTTP server is accessible.

4. QR Code Generation:
The script generates a QR code containing the server's URL (http://<local_ip>:8010) using the pyqrcode library.
The generated QR code is saved as an SVG image file named "myqr.svg" on the user's desktop.

4.Opening the QR Code:
The script automatically opens the generated QR code file ("myqr.svg") in the default web browser, making it easy for users to access the file sharing service by scanning the QR code with a mobile device.

5.User Instructions:
Upon starting the HTTP server, the script prints instructions for accessing the server either by typing the displayed URL (http://<local_ip>:8010) in a web browser or by scanning the displayed QR code.
